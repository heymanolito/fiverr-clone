## Learning outcomes
- We have used agile methodologies (Kanban) to organize the project workflow.
- We have learned how to create a Rest API with SpringBoot.
- We have learned how to develop the frontend using React.js.
- We have learned how to deploy an application in Heroku.
## 2. Assignment.
- The project must have an API, made in Spring Boot and that persists in the database.
- It must have two views made in React:
    - The job view (https://www.fiverr.com/categories/graphics-design/website-design)
    - The detail view of each job (https://www.fiverr.com/ushina_rabab/design-ui-ux-for-a-websites-and-landing-page-websites).
- In addition, we will be able to filter by the type of job (category): Web design / SEO / Development. The change of category will be a filter that will be done in both the backend and the frontend.
